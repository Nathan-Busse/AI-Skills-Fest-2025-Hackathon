## Overview

The AI Skills Fest 2025 Hackathon is an exciting event and a collaborative opportunity for developers, data scientists, and AI enthusiasts to build impactful solutions using Microsoftâ€™s AI platforms. Our mission is to foster innovation, encourage best practices in development, and maintain high code quality with a robust set of repository guidelines.

## Challenge Details

- *Event:* AI Skills Fest 2025 Hackathon  
- *Theme:* Innovate with AI â€“ Create solutions that address real-world challenges using advanced AI technologies.  
- *Date:* [Insert Hackathon Dates]  
- *Organizer:* Microsoft AI Skills Fest

Participants are challenged to develop projects that not only demonstrate proficiency in AI technologies but also adhere to best practices in code management and collaboration.

## Repository Setup

To ensure a stable and secure development process, the repository is configured with essential best practices including:

- *Branch Protection:* Strict policies for the primary branch (default CODE or renamed to main) to enforce code reviews and safe commits.
- *CI/CD Integration:* Automated workflows for dependency updates, security analysis, and code quality checks.
  - Example configurations include Dependabot (.github/dependabot.yml) and CodeQL analysis (.github/workflows/codeql.yml).
  
These configuration files are located in the .github directory and can be customized further as needed.

## Branch Protection Policy

Maintaining code integrity is paramount. Our branch protection rules include:

- *Primary Branch:* The main development branch is CODE (or main after renaming).
- *Rules Implemented:*
  - Force pushes are disallowed to ensure a clean and traceable commit history.
  - Branch deletion is prevented to safeguard our core code.
  - Even administrators must adhere to these rules, ensuring that every change is reviewed via pull requests.
