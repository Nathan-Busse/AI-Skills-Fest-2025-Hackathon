        Who wrote the sample?
        
        Because of the way this repository is configured, sample authors do not get a notification when you create an issue. 
        
        For the section above, **@mention any author of the sample**. The authors' GitHub handle can be found on the main sample documentation page, under the "Solution" section. 
        
        Issues without an @mention will be closed automatically, as the authors won't get notified.
        
        **NOTE:** Don't @mention the repo maintainers; they already get notified.
